        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I've had a love for computers for as long as I can remember. I remember when I was about 4 or 5 my father bought me a laptop from a garage sale. It weighed about 20 pounds and it had a floppy drive. I spent every moment I could playing on it.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've built multiple computers, I've taken a few different courses for different programming languages, but HTML/CSS/JS has been the first one to stick. I'm hopeful that I'll get through the tech degree plan in a timely manner and start a career.</p>
